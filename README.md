# Vacation-Rental-Company-NYC
A vacation rental company based out of NYC is looking to get some information on the market using data from Airbnbs that are currently operating. They want to know answer a few questions to decide where to purchase properties:

What neighborhoods command the highest premium and best reviews? 
How much of a difference in price or review score is there based on the amount of bedrooms? 
What areas have the highest concentration of listings in one area?
If we want to venture outside of Manhattan, will the cheaper real estate outweigh the decrease in revenue? Are scores as high in other boroughs?
How important is your profile? Being a superhost, being verified, being on the platform for a long time?
How important are the amount of reviews you have?

In order to answer these questions I first reformat the data and then explore it to give the company some answers.
